          <p>My name is Abby Bogert, and I am an almost 5 year old Miniature Pischer/Jack Russell Mix.
          I am originally from Nashville, TN but found my forever home on Dec 26 2015, when my humans who were
        visiting their family from Michigan decided to take me home with them. I love to play fetch, run very fast,
      catch food that is thrown my way, take naps and growl when someone walks by my window or door. When i'm not at home, I go to work with my humans where I
    greet all the people who come in to visit where if i'm lucky I will get pets and on special occasions even some treats!<br><br>
  I recently spent some time in my hometown of Nashville where I got to be with my grandma and her dog Pearl. I don't usally
spend a lot of time with other dogs, but we got to play fetch (I played fetch, while pearl ran around with a ball in her mouth),
stared in amazement at the birds that were in the house, and didn't complain that I was fed more than I typically am. </p>
